# Serverless Spring Boot 3 example
A basic pet store written with the [Spring Boot 3 framework](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/). Unlike older examples, this example is relying on the new 
`SpringDelegatingLambdaContainerHandler`, which you simply need to identify as a   _handler_  of the Lambda function. The main configuration class identified as `MAIN_CLASS`
environment variable or `Start-Class` or `Main-Class` entry in Manifest file. See provided `template.yml` file  for reference. 


The application can be deployed in an AWS account using the [Serverless Application Model](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model). The `template.yml` file in the root folder contains the application definition.

## Pre-requisites
* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* [SAM CLI](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) or [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

## Deployment
In a shell, navigate to the sample's folder and use the SAM CLI to build a deployable package
```
$ sam build
```

This command compiles the application and prepares a deployment package in the `.aws-sam` sub-directory.

To deploy the application in your AWS account, you can use the SAM CLI's guided deployment process and follow the instructions on the screen

```
$ sam deploy --guided
```

Once the deployment is completed, the SAM CLI will print out the stack's outputs, including the new application URL. You can use `curl` or a web browser to make a call to the URL
